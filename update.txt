we have started to create a music maker that will use user input and predetermined musicality to generate a 
musical composition for the piano.  it is only partially finished the chord processing section which is almost 
complete is the last step before the music genereator portion is finished some fine tuing with the ui needs to 
be completed.  the MusicMakerproject.elm file doesnt compile at this time, theres a choice that needs to be 
made with regaurds to how a particulaar type will work before that can move forward.
